            <h3>Calvin</h3>
            <p>Calvin is a fictional character, and is the title character of the
            comic strip Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. Calvin demonstrates
            a level of wisdom, vocabulary and humor unusual for a six year-old
            boy. However, in many ways he is typical for his age: he absolutely
            hates baths, and fears and hates his babysitter, refuses to go to
            school, frequently disobeys his parents, and is lazy and selfish.
            Calvin frequently loses himself in various fantastical worlds of
            his own imagining. On the rare occasions on which he applies himself,
            Calvin's projects in school are very well received, to his confusion
            or indifference. He shows relatively minor interest or success in
            interacting with any "real" characters, choosing instead to spend
            the majority of his time with Hobbes, with whom he frequently
            embarks on imaginary adventures, debates philosophical issues,
            plots various pranks against girls, and fights.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="2" class="card">
            <h3>Dad</h3>
            <p>Calvin's father is a patent attorney, portrayed to the reader as
            an upstanding middle-class father despite how his son may see him.
            An outdoorsman, he enjoys bike rides and camping trips, sometimes in
            extreme weather and insists that these activities, like Calvin's chores,
            "build character". Though his age is never specified, when Calvin offers
            him a bowl of chocolate cereal, he replies "No thanks, I'm trying to
            reach middle age."</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="3" class="card">
            <h3>Hobbes</h3>
            <p>Hobbes is seen in two differentiating perspectives. Calvin perceives
            him as a live tiger and a best friend. To everybody else, he's a
            stuffed tiger. Hobbes is often shown to be smarter and wiser than
            Calvin when he is perceived as a real tiger. He is seen reading more
            often than his owner and tries to be the voice of reason when Calvin
            tries to perform a risky stunt or engage in a dubious scheme. Hobbes'
            advice mostly has no effect on Calvin, who usually ignores Hobbes's
            reasoning and winds up getting in trouble for his actions. Because of
            this, some fans say that Hobbes represents Calvin's conscience. However,
            Hobbes is shown to be terrible at math, quite possibly worse than
            Calvin himself.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="4" class="card">
            <h3>Miss Wormwood</h3>
            <p>Miss Wormwood is Calvin's schoolteacher, named after the junior
            devil in C. S. Lewis' The Screwtape Letters. She usually wears
            polka-dotted dresses, and serves as a foil to Calvin's mischief.
            Despite a large progression of time in the Calvin and Hobbes Universe
            (10 years), mainly exhibited by the changing seasons, every character
            seems to remain exactly the same age, with the exception of Susie. As
            a result, Calvin and Susie return to Miss Wormwood's first-grade class
            every fall. (Watterson has explained that comic-strip characters
            typically do not age.)</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="5" class="card">
            <h3>Moe</h3>
            <p>Moe is the stereotypical bully character, and one of the primary
            villains, along with Rosalyn and the Monsters under the Bed. His
            (frequently monosyllabic) dialogue is shown in crude, lower-case
            letters (probably the most intellectual words Moe has ever used are
            "asphalt" "spatula", and "skin grafts"). Watterson describes Moe as
            "every jerk I've ever met " and reflects his memory of "school being
            full of idiots like Moe." . Moe is the only minor character in the
            strip who hurts Calvin without being provoked, and is also the only
            significant character never portrayed with sympathy. Moe steals
            Calvin's toy truck by threatening to punch him, and when Calvin
            demands it be returned, taunts Calvin to a "fight" over it. Calvin
            is disgusted by Moe's lack of conscience and angrily tells him off
            "You're the one who has to live with yourself! I can't make you do
            what's right! You can HAVE the stupid truck!" To which Moe coldly
            responds "Ok, thanks! Heh. Heh."</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="6" class="card">
            <h3>Mom</h3>
            <p>Calvin's mother is a stay-at-home mom who is frequently exasperated
            by Calvin's antics. Before Calvin's birth, she worked a stressful
            job filled with aggravation, which Calvin's father claims is the
            reason she was better prepared to stay at home and raise Calvin.
            Whether or not he was jesting is debatable. On the rare occasions
            when she is not reacting to Calvin's misbehavior, she seems to enjoy
            quiet activities, such as gardening and reading. She is frequently
            the one forced to curb Calvin's destructive tendencies; in one Sunday
            strip, she allows Calvin to smoke a cigarette in order to teach him
            how unpleasant smoking can be. She also usually seems sympathetic
            towards her son's relationship with Hobbes, and a few times has found
            herself speaking to Hobbes as well, though this embarrasses her. She
            has even called out to Hobbes once the same way Calvin did when she
            was looking for him, perhaps implying that, like her husband,
            Calvin's mother also has her own moments of playful imagination,
            despite generally being a straight-laced adult.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="7" class="card">
            <h3>Rosalyn</h3>
            <p>Rosalyn is a high school senior and the only babysitter able to
            tolerate Calvin's antics. Calvin is often terrified of her; but
            in the final Rosalyn story, their opposition is averted by a game
            of Calvinball, which Rosalyn wins (this makes Rosalyn the only
            character in the strip to have a conclusive story arc). In nearly
            all the "Rosalyn stories", Rosalyn is shown demanding advance payment
            and raises in wage from Calvin's parents, supposedly to pay for
            college or for the hard work necessary to control Calvin. (For
            the same reason, she briefly appears as Calvin's swimming instructor.)
            In at least four stories, Rosalyn telephones her boyfriend, Charlie,
            to cancel prearranged meetings which she cannot fulfill. (Charlie
            remains an unseen character.) Calvin sometimes urges Charlie to
            stop courting Rosalyn, on grounds that Rosalyn is sadistic and/or
            insane. Rosalyn is one of the only two major characters with no
            role in a Spaceman Spiff strip; the other being Hobbes.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="8" class="card">
            <h3>Spaceman Spiff</h3>
            <p>Spaceman Spiff, "interplanetary explorer extraordinaire," explores
            the outermost reaches of the universe "by popular request" in a red
            flying saucer with a bubble canopy (resembling a UFO). As the comic
            developed and evolved over time, Watterson began to introduce Spiff's
            adventures with alliteration, featuring phrases such as, "Poised
            precariously over a percolating pit of putrid pasta." The galaxy in
            which Spiff travels is a cruel place where Spiff is shot down or
            captured by ferocious and disgusting aliens. In reality, these aliens
            are often people such as Calvin's parents or Miss Wormwood. Frequently,
            Spaceman Spiff becomes stranded on an unexplored planet due to alien
            attacks or malfunctioning equipment. Most of these planets seem devoid
            of civilization, and often have hostile environments or alien predators.
            Watterson based his alien landscapes on the rock formations of southern
            Utah and landscapes within the comic Krazy Kat. Gradually, the
            monsters became more detailed.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="9" class="card">
            <h3>Stupendous Man</h3>
            <p>Stupendous Man is a superhero Calvin often becomes. He, like Spaceman
            Spiff, narrates his own adventures in the third person. Stupendous
            Man has several nemeses: Mom Lady (Calvin's Mom), Babysitter Girl
            (Rosalyn), Annoying Girl (Susie Derkins), and the Crab Teacher
            (Miss Wormwood). Despite his frequent use of various "stupendous
            powers", Stupendous Man has admittedly only won "moral victories".
            In one strip, Stupendous Man had a battlecry, in which every letter
            that makes up the word stupendous, stood for something—a parody of
            Captain Marvel's magic word, "Shazam." This had limited success.</p>
        </li>
        <li data-card="10" class="card">
            <h3>Susie Derkins</h3>
            <p>Susie Derkins is a classmate of Calvin who lives in his neighborhood.
            She is the only recurring character in the comic strip to have both a forename
            and a surname revealed (other characters are mentioned briefly). She is also
            the only character who aged in the strip. Named after Watterson's in-laws'
            family beagle, she first appeared early in the strip as a new student in
            Calvin's class, but in later strips speaks as a longtime neighbor. In
            contrast to Calvin, she is polite and diligent in her studies, and her
            imagination usually seems mild-mannered and civilized, consisting of games
            such as playing "house" or having tea parties with her stuffed animals. Her
            parents have spoken in the strip several times, but it is never confirmed
            that they appear.</p>

        <li data-card="11" class="card">
            <h3>Tracer Bullet</h3>
            <p>Tracer Bullet is a hard-boiled private investigator styled after
            film noir and detective fiction stereotypes, such as Sam Spade of The
            Maltese Falcon or Philip Marlowe, who spouts incisive metaphors and
            wears a trench coat and fedora. He resembles Calvin, though the Frank
            Miller-like high-contrast art style Watterson uses in the Tracer Bullet
            strips obscures Bullet's features. Watterson considered this style
            dramatic but regarded it as time-consuming, and that the human eye has
            to work hard to study predominantly dark spaces, so he drew few Tracer
            Bullet strips. There have been only three strip sequences that involved
            Tracer Bullet. Tracer Bullet owns at least three guns: a .38 revolver,
            a .44 Magnum and a .45 handgun.</p>
